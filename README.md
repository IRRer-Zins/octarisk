Market Risk Measurement in Octave

This project aims to provide a framework for assessing the market risk of financial portfolios.

The code is written in Octave / Matlab language and will be useable right out-of-the box with Octave version >= 4.0.0.

## Installation

You need Octave in Version >=4.0 with installed statistics and financial package.
Moreover, an efficient linear algebra package is strongly recommended (e.g. OpenBLAS / LaPACK)

For detailed installation instructions please refer to the tutorial at www.octarisk.com.

## Compatibility

Octarisk runs on any system with a running Octave environment.
To my knowledge, Octave binaries are provided for MS Windows and Linux.

A system with at least 4Gb memory is recommended.

## Version history
